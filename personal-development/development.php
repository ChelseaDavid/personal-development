		<h1>Assignment:</h1>
		<!-- Quantitative -->
		<h2>3 Quantitative Qualities:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Responsible for lowest Physical Inventory right off in company history 2016 with a total
				right off in inventory of $0.97.</li>

		</ul>
		<!-- Qualitative -->
		<h2>3 Qualitative Qualities:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Punctual: always first in last out. Installers tend to get up and started between
				6 AM and 7</li>
			<li>Non-Profit work. Affiliations - Wounded Warrior, Habbitat for Humanity, Boys and Girls club ranch
				, Los Ranchos Boys Placement Housing</li>
			<li>Professional: Somewhat of a chameleon(in the best sense of course), I can adapt
				to the people and places of my surroundings. Which, being a female in a primarily
				"Mans driven" field, you almost have to be able to adapt.</li>
			<li>Clicker: most times you can find the answer yourself if you just "click"</li>
		</ul>
			<!-- What, How, Why -->
		<p	><strong>What -</strong>Sub/Independent Contractors & tradesman</p>
		<p><strong>How -</strong> creating a platform for these installers to advertise work available
			while simultaneously building a profile / online resume for future employers to view.
			(The age old saying " no one is going to call you for a job" is done ;-))</p>
		<p><strong>Why -</strong> Most of these tradesman ( Excluding Electrical) do not require
			licenses to install. Since doing away with it, they do not have a reliable profile / rating system
			to set them apart from anyone else. ( Person takes a tile class at Home Depot, thinks they are a
			tile installer)</p>
		<!-- Elevator Pitch -->
		<p><strong>Elevator Pitch-</strong></p>
		<p>Hi, My name is Chelsea. I work with tradesman, sub & independent contractors, creating a platform
			they may use to gain employment during slow times, and simultaneously build professional profiles
			and resumes. I am using my coding skills to make this dream a reality.<p>
		<p>Questions:</p>
		<p>Do you need work done on your home or business?</p>
		<p>Do you need an installer or know of one looking for work?</p>
		<p>Can't decide which question to use. Any and all critique is appreciated!
			Hope you are enjoying your weekend!</p>
